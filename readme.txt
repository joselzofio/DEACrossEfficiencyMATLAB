DEA Cross-Efficiency Toolbox for MATLAB
Version 1.0
Authors: Christian Kaps and José L. Zofío.

To use the Toolbox add the folder called "cetoolbox" to the MATLAB path.

The toolbox contains the following folders:

- crossefftoolbox: all the functions needed to calculate cross-efficiency are here. This is the folder you must add to the MATLAB path.

- exampledata: warehouse data studied in Balk, B.M. & de Koster, M.B.M. & Kaps, C. & Zofío, J.L., 2017. "An Evaluation of Cross-Efficiency Methods, Applied to Measuring Warehouse Performance," ERIM Report Series Research in Management ERS-2017-015-LIS, Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM). https://repub.eur.nl/pub/103185. The dataset, along with accompanying information on the survey methods and variable definitions, are available also for downloading in spreadsheet format at https://doi.org/10.25397/eur.8279426.
